# Homework Week 3 - Python Challenge
Two assignments to work on:
## 1. PyBank
A .CSV file with months and profit or loss (amounts) was provided, and students are supposed to find:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Finding month to month change in profit or loss amount is little bit tricky.

Folder PyBank has code file main.py and .txt file that is output of the main.py code.

## 2. PyPoll
A .csv file with voterID, County and Candidate was provided and students are asked to produce:

* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Folder PyPoll has code file main.py and .txt file that is output of the main.py code.
